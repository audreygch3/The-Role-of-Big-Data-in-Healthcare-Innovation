**Big data** is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by providing deep insights into patient outcomes, treatment effectiveness, and disease trends. With access to vast amounts of health data, healthcare providers can improve diagnostic accuracy, enhance personalized care, and make more informed decisions, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

The potential of big data in healthcare is enormous, but it also presents significant challengesâ€”especially around **privacy** and **security**. Protecting sensitive patient data is more important than ever as healthcare providers access and share information across digital platforms.

Proxies are an essential tool in ensuring the security and privacy of healthcare data.
